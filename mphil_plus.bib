  abstract = {The main question raised in this article is why movement of a phrase makes its copy left behind invisible for labeling. Adopting the assumption that movement consists of Copy and Merge, I propose that copying a phrase makes the original inactive in syntactic computation. I argue that this makes it possible (i) to derive the effects of the Phase-Impenetrability Condition on the assumption that Transfer involves Copy, (ii) to provide an account of that-trace effects in English, and (iii) to account for Rizzi's (2006) criterial freezing, as manifested in overt wh-movement in English. I further argue that the proposed system of labeling can be made compatible with the Agree-less approach, recently advocated by Hornstein (2009), with the assumption that feature-checking is conducted in labeling in terms of agreeing features. This brings us a nice consequence of properly dealing with the optionality of raising to object in the English ECM construction.},

They make many good points about Adger (2000; Core syntax – henceforth CS) which will help a great deal in improving the book for any future edition. Because of this, I don't want to dwell on any minor quibbles I have about their comments. Instead, I'd like to focus on some broader conclusions they draw about the theoretical devices used in CS and the perspective taken there. My remarks will address mainly SI's concerns about the feature theory I outlined in CS, and the question of movement.},

  abstract = {This book presents a critical overview of current work on linguistic features and establishes new bases for their use in the study and understanding of language. Features are fundamental components of linguistic description: they include gender (feminine, masculine, neuter); number (singular, plural, dual); person (1st, 2nd, 3rd); tense (present, past, future); and case (nominative, accusative, genitive, ergative). Despite their ubiquity and centrality in linguistic description, much remains to be discovered about them: there is, for example, no readily available inventory showing which features are found in which of the world's languages; there is no consensus about how they operate across different components of language; and there is no certainty about how they interact. This book seeks both to highlight and to tackle these problems. It brings together perspectives from phonology to formal syntax and semantics, expounding the use of linguistic features in typology, computer applications, and logic. Linguists representing different standpoints spell out clearly the assumptions they bring to different kinds of features and describe how they use them. Their contrasting contributions highlight the areas of difference and the common ground between their perspectives. The book brings together original work by leading international scholars. It will appeal to linguists of all theoretical persuasions.},

  abstract = {This book brings together a collection of recent studies based on work presented at a workshop that focussed on the question of how syntactic variation can be accounted for under minimalist premises. Issues addressed include the theoretical significance, content, and role of parameters within minimalism; whether or not variation should be strongly or weakly accounted for by syntactic factors; and the explicitness (or lack of it) that should be assumed with respect to the conditions imposed by narrow syntax. The first part contains chapters that consider the term parameter to be a relevant theoretical notion under minimalist tenets. In the second part, on the other hand, chapters either argue that the term ‘parameter’ amounts to no more than a label to describe variation, or assign it a less prominent role. Instead, language variation is attributed to socio‐linguistic factors, language contact, frequency of use, or simply to options in the externalization of abstract syntactic relations.},

There is also an issue concerning thejustification of principles, such as Occam's Razor, which favor simpletheories. The history of philosophy has seen many approaches todefending Occam's Razor, from the theological justifications of theEarly Modern period, to contemporary justifications employing resultsfrom probability theory and statistics.},

  abstract = {One of the defining properties of the narrowly Chomskian approach to syntax’ over the years has been its commitment to the idea that grammatical relations such as subject and object are not primitives of grammatical theory. Rather, these notions, inherited from traditional grammar, are to be understood in terms of more basic syntactic relationships, in particular phrase structure configurations. This view gives phrase structure a kind of primacy in Chomskian theory that it does not have in other frameworks. In this conceptually oriented paper, I want to reexamine this distinctive claim, reviewing the old controversy between Chomskian theory and Relational Grammar (RG) and related frameworks that that claim was part of. In the course of this, I will consider what the ongoing legacy of these debates is in the “post-RG” syntactic theories of the 2000s. This issue is roughly equivalent to the question of what the characteristic phrase structure representations of Chomskian theory actually mean within the network of assumptions that they are now embedded in. My basic claim is that the meaning of the old slogan has changed somewhat over time, as ideas about phrase structure have changed, in ways that have not been fully realized. In particular, the Chomskian notion of phrase structure has come partially unhinged from its origins as a representation of basic constituency facts. As a result, it is now fair to say that phrase structure is essentially a representation of grammatical function relationships, not fundamentally different in kind from the representations posited by the Relational Grammarians and others. However, I will argue that Chomskian phrase structure is a particularly good representation of grammatical relations. In particular, it is superior to relational nets or the f-structures of Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) in that it captures certain basic properties of linguistic prominence that are not captured by these more general and flexible-looking representational schemes. Thus, while the meaning of the claim that grammatical relations are derived from phrase structure has shifted over time, that claim is still meaningful. Finally, I will ask why it is that phrase structure is such a successful representation, showing how this relates to lexical semantic work on the decomposition of verbs into more basic components.},

  abstract = {The Science of Language, published in the sixth decade of Noam Chomsky's linguistic career, defends views that are visibly out of touch with recent research in formal linguistics, developmental child psychology, computational modeling of language acquisition, and language evolution. I argue that the poor quality of this volume is representative of the serious shortcomings of Chomsky's recent scholarship, especially of his criticism of and contribution to debates about language evolution. Chomsky creates the impression that he is quoting titbits of a massive body of scientific work he has conducted or is intimately familiar with. Yet his speculations reveal a lack of even basic understanding of biology, and an unwillingness to engage seriously with the relevant literature. At the same time, he ridicules the work of virtually all other theorists, without spelling out the views he disagrees with. A critical analysis of the ‘Galilean method’ demonstrates that Chomsky uses appeal to authority to insulate his own proposals against falsification by empirical counter-evidence. This form of discourse bears no serious relation to the way science proceeds.},

Recently, Jeffrey Watumull claimed that his putative novel and nontrivial unification reconciles the ontologies of biolinguistics and Platonism. I argue that Watumull offers no defense of Chomskyan biolinguistics because he misunderstands and misrepresents the arguments against it and defends a view that has been rejected by Chomsky. Unlike Chomsky, Watumull accepts the reality of abstract objects. But he offers no novel proposal for how the recursive algorithms could be implemented in a human brain. Nor does he pay any attention to cerebral neurophysiological properties. Finally, his speculations fail to show that a physical object could have abstract properties or vice versa. I conclude that six decades after the Chomskyan revolution, the foundations of biolinguistics remain internally incoherent.},

It offers fresh perspectives on language evolution and variation, new developments in theoretical linguistics, and insights on the relations between variation in language and variation in biology. The authors address the Darwinian questions on the origin and evolution of language from a minimalist perspective, and provide elegant solutions to the evolutionary gap betweenhuman language and communication in all other organisms. They consider language variation in the context of current biological approaches to species diversity - the 'evo-devo revolution' - which bring to light deep homologies between organisms. In dispensing with the classical notion of syntacticparameters, the authors argue that language variation, like biodiversity, is the result of experience and thus not a part of the language faculty in the narrow sense. They also examine the nature of this core language faculty, the primary categories with which it is concerned, the operations it performs, the syntactic constraints it poses on semantic interpretation and the role of phases in bridging the gap between brain and syntax. Written in language accessible to a wide audience, TheBiolinguistic Enterprise will appeal to scholars and students of linguistics, cognitive science, biology, and natural language processing.},

Furthermore, their specific evolutionary scenario counterproposal for a “two-step” evolution of Merge does not work. Although we agree with their Essay on several points, including that there must have been many steps in the evolution of human language and the importance of understanding how language and language syntax are implemented in the brain, we disagree that there is any justification, empirical or conceptual, for the decomposition of binary set formation into separate steps.},

Candidates for such invariances include the structure dependence of grammatical rules, and in particular, certain constraints on question formation. Various “poverty of stimulus” (POS) arguments suggest that these invariances reflect an innate human endowment, as opposed to common experience: Such experience warrants selection of the grammars acquired only if humans assume, a priori, that selectable grammars respect substantive constraints. Recently, several researchers have tried to rebut these POS arguments. In response, we illustrate why POS arguments remain an important source of support for appeal to a priori structure-dependent constraints on the grammars that humans naturally acquire.},

In particular, minimalism reveals a surprising paradox: human language is simpler than we thought, and yet it cannot be processed by the machinery used by computer scientists. In this volume, experts in the field show how to resolve this apparent paradox, and how to turn Chomsky’s abstract theories into working computer programs that can process sentences or make predictions about the time course of brain activity when dealing with language. The book will appeal to graduate students and researchers in formal syntax, computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, and computer science.},

In relation to Factor 3, I highlight a specific cognitive bias that appears well motivated outside of language, while also having wide-ranging consequences for our understanding of how I-language grammars are constructed, and why they should have the crosslinguistically comparable form that generativists have always argued human languages have. This is Maximise Minimal Means (MMM).

Although still widely assumed, the parametric theory of variation has in recent years been subject to re-evaluation and critique. The Null Subject Parameter, which determines among other things whether or not a language allows the suppression of subject pronouns, is one of the best-known and most widely discussed examples of a parameter. Nevertheless its status in current syntactic theory is highly controversial. This book is a defence of the parametric approach to linguistic variation, set within the framework of the Minimalist Program. It discusses syntactic variation in the light of recent developments in linguistic theory, focusing on issues such as the formal nature of minimalist parameters, the typology of null-subject language systems and the way in which parametric choices can be seen to underlie the synchronic and diachronic patterns observed in natural languages.},

  abstract = {Predicate fronting with doubling (also known as the predicate cleft) has long been a challenge for theories of syntax that do not predict the pronunciation of multiple occurrences. Previous analyses that derive the construction via syntactic movement, including those attributing verb doubling to the formation of parallel chains (e.g., Aboh 2006; Kandybowicz 2008), are incompatible with remnant movement (Müller 1998), which does not give rise to doubling. This article presents data from the predicate fronting construction in Yiddish, in which verbs always double but complements never do. I argue that these seemingly contradictory pronunciation facts can be reconciled even if one assumes that phrasal movement and head movement are both syntactic. More specifically, the pronunciation of occurrences in Yiddish (doubled or not) follows from the general conditions on Spell-Out (or Transferpf) defined by Collins and Stabler (2016), modified only to accommodate syntactic head movement. Post-syntactic PF repairs are thus not required to account for the facts of the Yiddish predicate fronting construction.

  abstract = {Evolutionary Phonology is a theory of sound patterns which synthesizes results in historical linguistics, phonetics and phonological theory. In this book, Juliette Blevins explores the nature of sounds patterns and sound change in human language over the past 7000–8000 years, the time depth for which the comparative method is reasonably reliable. This book presents an approach to the problem of how genetically unrelated languages, from families as far apart as Native American, Australian Aboriginal, Austronesian and Indo-European, can often show similar sound patterns, and also tackles the converse problem of why there are notable exceptions to most of the patterns that are often regarded as universal tendencies or constraints. It argues that in both cases, a formal model of sound change that integrates phonetic variation and patterns of misperception can account for attested sound systems without reference to markedness or naturalness within the synchronic grammar.}

  abstract = {This paper defends a recent idea concerning the way certain instances of syntactic movement are triggered. In particular, the idea is discussed that successive cyclic WH-movement comes about by iterated symmetrical structures of the form \{XP, YP\}, which cannot receive a label (cf. Chomsky in press, Ott 2011) and thus force unbounded movement. It is shown that the approach is preferable to preceding analyses (Boeckx 2003, Boškovíc 2007) on conceptual grounds, in that fewer technicalia are needed and in that problems of the mentioned analyses, which the author of this paper addresses, are avoided. Implied in the proposal is that Merge is not constrained to generate asymmetrical structures only (pace Kayne 2011). Two devices for how movement comes to a halt are discussed.},

And how can constraints on syntactic movement be derived from interface conditions and so-called Third Factor principles? Within the Minimalist Program a standard answer to the first question is that it is driven by morphosyntactic features. This monograph challenges that view and suggests that the role of features in driving syntactic computation has been overestimated. Instead it proposes that "labeling" -- the detection of a prominent element in sets formed by Merge -- plays a role in driving transformations, and labeling itself is understood to derive from an interplay of efficient computation and the need for a label at the Conceptual-Intentional systems. It explores this idea in four empirical domains: Long-distance dependencies, Criterial Freezing-phenomena, nested dependencies and ATB-movement. The languages considered include English, German and Hebrew.},

  abstract = {This paper suggests a novel syntactic treatment of adverbial clauses. The point of departure is the observation – in German and Slavic languages – that there exists an asymmetry in the complexity of subordinating elements in complement and adverbial clauses: While the former feature simplex complementizers, i.e. heads, the latter to a large extent feature complex prepositional phrases in addition to the adverbial CP. Sense can be made of this observation if adverbial clauses exhibit a structure \{PP, CP\} in the specifier-less framework of Chomsky (2013). The labeling algorithm suggested in that work delivers no result, i.e. structure remains exocentric in line with the spirit of suggestions regarding adjuncts more generally (Hornstein \&amp; Nunes 2008). The underlying reason for the asymmetry is thus that C-elements must be simplex to ensure that the selected complement clause is properly endowed with a syntactic category. There is no corresponding need for this in (unselected) adverbial clauses, and hence no derivational problem for Merging PP with CP which suppresses the application of the labeling algorithm.},

It offers fresh perspectives on language evolution and variation, new developments in theoretical linguistics, and insights on the relations between variation in language and variation in biology. The authors address the Darwinian questions on the origin and evolution of language from a minimalist perspective, and provide elegant solutions to the evolutionary gap betweenhuman language and communication in all other organisms. They consider language variation in the context of current biological approaches to species diversity - the 'evo-devo revolution' - which bring to light deep homologies between organisms. In dispensing with the classical notion of syntacticparameters, the authors argue that language variation, like biodiversity, is the result of experience and thus not a part of the language faculty in the narrow sense. They also examine the nature of this core language faculty, the primary categories with which it is concerned, the operations it performs, the syntactic constraints it poses on semantic interpretation and the role of phases in bridging the gap between brain and syntax. Written in language accessible to a wide audience, TheBiolinguistic Enterprise will appeal to scholars and students of linguistics, cognitive science, biology, and natural language processing.},

Hagit Borer departs from language specific constructional approaches and from lexicalist approaches to argue that universal hierarchical structures determine interpretation, and that language variation emerges from the morphological and phonological properties of inflectional material. Taking Form, the third and final volume of Structuring Sense, applies this radical approach to the construction of complex words. Integrating research in syntax and morphology, the author develops a new model of word formation, arguing that on the one hand the basic building blocks of language are rigid semantic and syntactic functions, while on the other hand they are roots, which in themselves are but packets of phonological information, and are devoid of both meaning and grammatical properties of any kind. Within such a model, syntactic category, syntactic selection and argument structure are all mediated through syntactic structures projected from rigid functions, or alternatively, constructed through general combinatorial principles of syntax, such as Chomsky's Merge. The meaning of'words', in turn, does not involve the existence of lexemes, but rather the matching of a well-defined and phonologically articulated syntactic domain with conceptual Content, itself outside the domain of language as such. In a departure from most current models of syntax but in line with many philosophical traditions, then, the Exo-Skeletal model partitions'meaning'into formal functions, on the one hand, and Content, on the other hand. While the former are read off syntactico-semantic structures as is usually assumed, Content is crucially read off syntactico-phonological structures.},

Intermediate [Spec,IP]s are filled as a result of the requirement of successive cyclicity (i.e., locality); otherwise they remain empty, which is unexpected if the EPP were to hold. In particular, intermediate [Spec,IP]s remain empty in constructions involving expletive subjects, which I argue do not move at all.

  abstract = {The article proposes a new theory of successive-cyclic movement that reconciles the early and the current minimalist approaches to it. As in the early approach, there is no feature checking in intermediate positions of successive-cyclic movement. However, as in the current approach and unlike in early minimalism, successive-cyclic movement starts before the final target of movement enters the structure, and Form Chain is eliminated. The locality of Move and the locality of Agree are shown to be radically different, Agree being free from several mechanisms that constrain Move, namely, phases and the Activation Condition. However, there is no need to take phases to define locality domains of syntax or to posit the Activation Condition as an independent principle. They still hold empirically for Move as theorems. The Generalized EPP (the “I need a Spec” property of attracting heads) and the Inverse Case Filter are also dispensable. The traditional Case Filter, stated as a checking requirement, is the sole driving force of A-movement. More generally, Move is always driven by a formal inadequacy (an uninterpretable feature) of the moving element, while Agree is target driven. The system resolves a lookahead problem that arises under the EPP-driven movement approach, where the EPP diacritic indicating that X moves is placed on Y, not X, although X often needs to start moving before Y enters the structure.},

Taking as the starting point the well-known difference between NPs and VPs regarding extraction, where extraction from Complex NPs is not possible while extraction from Complex VPs is possible, the article argues that the former represents a pervasive pattern found in many contexts, the latter being highly exceptional. More precisely, extraction is impossible not only from clausal but all complements of nouns. Furthermore, it is impossible from complements of prepositions and adjectives as well as ergative verbs. A deduction of the impossibility of extraction from the complements of lexical heads (other than non-ergative verbs) is proposed based on a new approach to phases (i.e. to what counts as a phase) and the Phase-Impenetrability Condition, as well as a particular implementation of Chomsky’s (2013) labeling algorithm. The analysis is extended to the Subject Condition effect and the that-trace effect.},

  abstract = {An appealing property of the phase theory is that it is relevant to many phenomena, i.e. many domain-based mechanisms are stated in terms of phases. However, although phasal complements have no theoretical status in the phase theory (only phases do), they are taken to define spell-out units. This paper argues for an approach where phases define spell-out domains, which means that what is sent to spell-out is the phase itself. Several arguments to this effect are presented regarding syntax phonology interaction (in particular, encliticization in Bulgarian and Arabic, stress assignment in German and English, raddoppiamento fonosintattico in Abruzzese, and tone sandhi in Taiwanese), as well as more theoretical issues such as labeling. The assumption, however, has significant consequences for successive-cyclic movement. If phases are sent to spell-out and what is sent to spell-out is inaccessible to the syntax, successive-cyclic movement cannot target phases. Under the account argued for here, successive-cyclic movement therefore does not proceed via phases (i.e. phasal edges). As a result, the account also eliminates the PIC.},

  abstract = {The article deduces a modified version of the traditional ban on movement out of moved elements that provides a new perspective on it. Under the proposed analysis, the problem with the movement of YP out of moved XP does not arise at the point where YP moves out of XP, as in previous accounts. Instead, it arises already with the movement of XP: XP itself cannot undergo movement in this case. Any later movement out of XP is then trivially blocked. The proposed analysis leaves room for movement out of moved elements to take place in well-defined contexts. Several constructions bear this out, including German/Dutch r-pronoun constructions, Slavic left-branch extraction, and quantifier float more generally. What the proposed analysis deduces is then not the traditional ban on movement out of moved elements, but a ban on movement of phases with nonagreeing specifiers, which the article argues should replace the former ban. As a result, the analysis also extends to the immobility of verb-second clauses in German. The article also provides a new perspective on the Adjunct Condition (the ban on movement out of adjuncts). It shows that movement out of adjuncts is possible in the same configuration as movement out of moved elements. The proposed account of the latter is then extended to the Adjunct Condition. The article also proposes a labeling-based account of the Coordinate Structure Constraint, which also captures the across-the-board-movement exception.},

The paper also sheds light on the ban on local wh-movement from SpecTP to SpecCP which is argued to require a return to split IP: it is shown that subjects undergoing wh-movement cannot move to the highest projection in the split IP even when the next step of movement is not SpecCP.},

It is shown that labeling plays a crucial role in the way the two interact in that unlabeled elements cannot undergo movement, cannot function as interveners, and cannot be targeted by movement. The discussion in the paper also leads to a new contextual approach to the EPP, where the satisfaction of the EPP is not tied to a particular position. This in turn is put into a broader perspective involving broader movement toward contextuality in the grammar in general: the contextuality of syntax is shown to manifest itself in the locality of movement/islandhood (there are in fact no islands as this notion has been traditionally understood—there are no phrases that by their nature, independently of their syntactic context, disallow extraction), the motivation for movement, structure building, labeling, as well as the new conception of the EPP.},

  abstract = {Asymmetrical, disharmonic and skewed distributions are widespread in several domains of the human language system as a whole. These patterns, which, if conceived as a logical space generated by a 2-by-2 factorial design, often appear to fall into a skewed, asymmetrical configuration; frequently, a clear-cut 3-out-of-4 pattern can be established but, if not, a general imbalance is usually still predominant. \{\textbackslash em Inter alia\}, examples of such configurations are Holmberg's Generalisation, FOFC, the Square of Opposition (\{\textbackslash em id est\} the nonlexicalisation of the O corner), Romance Interrogatives, Greenberg's Universal 25, Monotonicity and constraints on negation, Subject-Pro-Drop, N-drop, clause syntax and illocutionary force mismatching etc.\textbackslash\textbackslash{} The central question to pose is whether such 3/4-patterns underlyingly are significant for the Faculty of Language or whether they simply are epiphenomena without further meaning or implications. In this article I argue that linguistic structures are sets of sets of purely privative atomic features which display surface phenomena such as asymmetries or skewings as a consequence of underlying feature interaction; I call this the Atomic Feature Conjecture. I suggest that features are combined by means of Merge and I demonstrate that there are three types of feature relationships: independence, dependence and antagonism. As far as asymmetry is concerned, I define two types of asymmetrical patterns: Type B, simultaneous incompatibility; and Type M, feature dependence. I furthermore outline consequences of these findings for Linguistic Theory, emphasising, on the one hand, the importance of privative features, and, on the other hand, the notion of the empty set as a fundamental component of the computational system. Ultimately, I also address remaining theoretical dilemmas stemming from the proposal and discuss future directions that cross-disciplinary research within the field could take.},

Chomsky takes this to indicate that the external argument is in its base position, Spec, vP, when C is merged. Our paper argues that this approach cannot generalize to account for why only V+v and not D of an external argument can raise to T in V-v-to-T languages. It also has major difficulties accounting for a well-known asymmetry: T raises to C only in English non-subject questions.

We replace them with a unique algorithm, the Probing Algorithm, which states that the Probe of any kind of Merge always provides the label. In addition to capturing core cases of phrase structure building, this algorithm sheds light on Principle C effects and on the syntax of wh-constructions, which we analyze as cases of conflict between two Probes. In these two configurations a lexical item (which should become the label, being endowed with an Edge Feature that qualifies it by definition as a Probe) is merged with a syntactic object that, being the probe of the operation, should also become the label. In one case, this conflict produces two alternative outputs (a question or a free relative) that are both acceptable. In Principle C configurations, one of the resulting outputs (the one where the lexical item “wins”) produces an object that is not interpretable. This way, Principle C effects are reduced to cases of mislabeling, with no need to postulate a specific condition to rule them out.},

We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that producen-order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasingn, to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of "phrase structure" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language.},

  abstract = {The book from which these sections are excerpted (N. Chomsky, Rules and Representations, Columbia University Press, 1980) is concerned with the prospects for assimilating the study of human intelligence and its products to the natural sciences through the investigation of cognitive structures, understood as systems of rules and representations that can be regarded as “mental organs.” These mental structui′es serve as the vehicles for the exercise of various capacities. They develop in the mind on the basis of an innate endowment that permits the growth of rich and highly articulated structures along an intrinsically determined course under the triggering and partially shaping effect of experience, which fixes parameters in an intricate system of predetermined form. It is argued that the mind is modular in character, with a diversity of cognitive structures, each with its specific properties arid principles. Knowledge of language, of the behavior of objects, and much else crucially involves these mental structures, and is thus not characterizable in terms of capacities, dispositions, or practical abilities, nor is it necessarily grounded in experience in the standard sense of this term.Various types of knowledge and modes of knowledge acquisition are discussed in these terms. Some of the properties of the language faculty are investigated. The basic cognitive relation is “knowing a grammar”; knowledge of language is derivative and, correspondingly, raises further problems. Language as commonly understood is not a unitary phenomenon but involves a number of interacting systems: the “computational” system of grammar, which provides the representations of sound and meaning that permit a rich range of expressive potential, is distinct from a conceptual system with its own properties; knowledge of language must be distinguished from knowledge of how to use a language; and the various systems that enter into the knowledge and use of language must be further analyzed into their specific subcomponents.},

  abstract = {This monograph explores several complex questions concerning the theories of government and bounding, including, in particular, the possibility of a unified approach to these topics. Starting with the intuitive idea that certain categories in certain configurations are barriers to government and movement, it considers whether the same categories are barriers in the two instances or whether one barrier suffices to block government (a stricter and'more local'relation) while more than one barrier inhibits movement, perhaps in a graded manner.Any proposal concerning the formulation of the concept of government has intricate consequences, and many of the empirical phenomena that appear to be relevant are still poorly understood. Similarly, judgments about the theory of movement also involve a number of different factors, including sensitivity to lexical choice. Therefore, Chomsky proceeds on the basis of speculations as to the proper idealization of complex phenomena - how they should be sorted into a variety of interacting systems (some of which remain quite obscure), which may tentatively be put aside to be explained by independent (sometimes unknown) factors, and which may be considered relevant to the subsystems under investigation.Barriers considers several possible paths through the maze of possibilities that arise. It sets the subtheory context (x-bar theory, theory of movement, and government) for determining what constitutes a barrier and explores two concepts of barrier - maximal projection and the minimality condition - and their manifestations in and implications for proper government, subjacency, island violations, vacuous movement, parasitic gaps, and A-chains.},

This 2002 volume begins with a lucid introduction by the editors Adriana Belletti and Luigi Rizzi. This is followed by some of Chomsky's writings on these themes, together with a penetrating interview in which Chomsky provides the clearest and most elegant introduction to current theory available. It should make his Minimalist Program accessible to all. The volume concludes with an essay on the role of intellectuals in society and government. Nature and Language is a significant landmark in the development of linguistic theory. It will be welcomed by students and researchers in theoretical linguistics, neurolinguistics, cognitive science and politics, as well as anyone interested in the development of Chomsky's thought.},

  abstract = {Tyler Burge has produced groundbreaking work on the semantics of proper names and indexicals, de re belief, formal truth theories, semantic and epistemic paradoxes, the philosophy of Gottlob Frege, and other areas of the philosophy of language and of mind. But he is best known for his arguments for anti-individualism, or externalism about mental content. Burge's aim in pursuing anti-individualism is nothing less than the solution to some of the most trenchant metaphysical and epistemological problems, including the nature of objectivity and norms, the force of skeptical arguments, apriority, and the nature of the self. Central to all of these is an account of intentional content that includes a penetrating critique of the empiricist notion of a concept.This book focuses mainly on Burge's work on anti-individualism. In it, various philosophers either comment on Burge's work or relate it to their own. An unusual feature is the generosity—both in volume and content—of Burge's contribution to this philosophical conversation. The section containing his responses comprises the most sustained, detailed, and interconnected body of writing that he has published in one place.},

  abstract = {The biolinguistic perspective regards the language faculty as an ‘‘organ of the body,’’ along with other cognitive systems. Adopting it, we expect to find three factors that interact to determine (I-) languages attained: genetic endowment (the topic of Universal Grammar), experience, and principles that are language- or even organism-independent. Research has naturally focused on I-languages and UG, the problems of descriptive and explanatory adequacy. The Principles-and-Parameters approach opened the possibility for serious investigation of the third factor, and the attempt to account for properties of language in terms of general considerations of computational efficiency, eliminating some of the technology postulated as specific to language and providing more principled explanation of linguistic phenomena.},

  abstract = {The traditional conception of language is that it is, in Aristotle's phrase, sound with meaning. The sound-meaning correlation is, furthermore, unbounded, an elementary fact that came to be understood as of great significance in the 17th century scientific revolution. In contemporary terms, the internal language (I-language) of an individual consists, at the very least, of a generative process that yields an infinite array of structured expressions, each interpreted at two interfaces, the sensory-motor interface (sound, sign, or some other sensory modality) for externalization and the conceptual-intentional interface for thought and planning of action. The earliest efforts to address this problem, in the 1950s, postulated rich descriptive apparatus—in different terms, rich assumptions about the genetic component of the language faculty, what has been called “universal grammar” (UG). That seemed necessary to provide for a modicum of descriptive adequacy. Also, many puzzles were discovered that had passed unnoticed, and in some cases still pose serious problems. A primary goal of linguistic theory since has been to try to reduce UG assumptions to a minimum, both for standard reasons of seeking deeper explanations, and also in the hope that a serious approach to language evolution, that is, evolution of UG, might someday be possible. There have been two approaches to this problem: one seeks to reduce or totally eliminate UG by reliance on other cognitive processes; the second has approached the same goal by invoking more general principles that may well fall within extra-biological natural law, particularly considerations of minimal computation, particularly natural for a computational system like language. The former approach is now prevalent if not dominant in cognitive science and was largely taken for granted 50 years ago at the origins of inquiry into generative grammar. It has achieved almost no results, though a weaker variant—the study of interactions between UG principles and statistical-based learning-theoretical approaches—has some achievements to its credit. The latter approach in contrast has made quite considerable progress. In recent years, the approach has come to be called “the minimalist program,” but it is simply a continuation of what has been undertaken from the earliest years, and while considered controversial, it seems to me no more than normal scientific rationality. One conclusion that appears to emerge with considerable force is that Aristotle's maxim should be inverted: language is meaning with sound, a rather different matter. The core of language appears to be a system of thought, with externalization a secondary process (including communication, a special case of externalization). If so, much of the speculation about the nature and origins of language is on the wrong track. The conclusion seems to accord well with the little that is understood about evolution of language, and with the highly productive studies of language acquisition of recent years.},

Since then inquiry has gained far greater scope and depth. It has also led to sharpening of fundamental principles of language. At first, descriptive adequacy appeared to require rich and complex assumptions about UG. A primary goal has always been to overcome this deficiency. Core properties of concern have included compositionality, order, projection (labeling), and displacement. Early work assigned the first three to phrase structure rules and the last to the transformational component. Simplification of computational procedures suggests that compositionality and displacement (along with the “copy theory”) fall together while order may be a reflex of sensorimotor externalization, conclusions that have far-reaching consequences. As for labeling, minimal computation restricts options to the few that have considerable empirical support.},

  abstract = {There is substantial evidence that the human language capacity (LC) is a species-specific biological property, essentially unique to humans, invariant among human groups, and dissociated from other cognitive systems. Each language, an instantiation of LC, consists of a generative procedure that yields a discrete infinity of hierarchically structured expressions with semantic interpretations, hence a kind of “language of thought” (LOT), along with an operation of externalization (EXT) to some sensory-motor system, typically sound. There is mounting evidence that generation of LOT observes language-independent principles of computational efficiency and is based on the simplest computational operations, and that EXT is an ancillary process not entering into the core semantic properties of LOT and is the primary locus of the apparent complexity, diversity, and mutability of language. These conclusions are not surprising, since the internal system is acquired virtually without evidence in fundamental respects, and EXT relates it to sensory-motor systems that are unrelated to it. Even such properties as the linear order of words appear to be reflexes of the sensory motor system, not available to generation of LOT. The limited evidence from the evolutionary record lends support to these conclusions, suggesting that LC emerged with Homo sapiens or not long after, and has not evolved since human groups dispersed.},

Here, Chomsky reviews some foundational aspects of the theory of structure building: essentially, Merge and Label. The aim is to eliminate what he refers to as extensions of Merge which are seemingly incompatible with the Strong Minimalist Thesis while still accounting for recursive structure, displacement, and reconstruction (as the main empirical goals of the Minimalist Program). These include sidewards movement, multi-dominance, and late- Merge; all of which have been developed throughout the life cycle of transformational generative grammar. Furthermore, Chomsky formulates a series of conditions that an adequate formulation of Merge must meet, and sketches how the aforementioned extensions may violate these conditions. Chomsky arrives at a formulation of an operation MERGE, which maintains the core properties of Merge but is further restricted by limitations over what MERGE can do to the workspaces where syntactic operations apply.},

Synchronic linguistics had been established as a science, a “taxonomic” science, with sophisticated procedures of analysis of data. Taxonomic science has limits. It does not ask “why?” The time was ripe to seek explanatory theories, using insights provided by the theory of computation and studies of explanatory depth. That effort became the generative enterprise within the biolinguistics framework. Tensions quickly arose: The elements of explanatory theories (generative grammars) were far beyond the reach of taxonomic procedures. The structuralist principle that language is a matter of training and habit, extended by analogy, was unsustainable. More generally, the mood of “virtually everything is known” became “almost nothing is understood,” a familiar phenomenon in the history of science, opening a new and exciting era for a flourishing discipline.},

Thus, the only option for such subjects is to move from [Spec, TP] or never land there. We argue for the latter option, motivating it for PPs in Polish locative inversion, instrumental DPs in Polish predicate inversion, dative subjects in Russian and Polish, genitive subjects in Lithuanian Inferential Evidentials, and accusative DPs in Russian and Polish Adversity Impersonals. We conclude by showing that under certain very restricted circumstances (i.e. when partial Agree takes place or Agree for structural case holds but Agree for phi-features is attempted and fails for independent reasons), the non-nominative elements can remain in [Spec, TP].},

  abstract = {Any theory of grammar must contain a lexicon, an interface with the mechanisms of production and perception (PF), and an interface with the interpretational system of semantics (LF). A traditional way to relate these three components in generative theory is through a derivation. Noam Chomsky's Minimalist Program postulates that grammatical derivations are constrained by economy conditions, requiring that derivations be minimal. One of the most important questions of syntax is what the economy conditions are and how they operate. In Local Economy, Chris Collins proposes that economy conditions are local. According to this theory, evaluating economy conditions does not involve comparing whole derivations. Rather, economy conditions are evaluated at each step in the derivation. Collins shows that locative inversion and quotative inversion provide strong arguments for local economy. In addition, he explores the far-reaching consequences of this proposal for other areas of syntax, including the strict cycle, binary branching, successive cyclicity, and expletive constructions. He demonstrates that local economy is superior to global economy on conceptual as well as empirical grounds. Local Economy is one of the first books other than Chomsky's The Minimalist Program (MIT, 1995) to deal in a general way with economy of derivation and Minimalism.

It offers fresh perspectives on language evolution and variation, new developments in theoretical linguistics, and insights on the relations between variation in language and variation in biology. The authors address the Darwinian questions on the origin and evolution of language from a minimalist perspective, and provide elegant solutions to the evolutionary gap betweenhuman language and communication in all other organisms. They consider language variation in the context of current biological approaches to species diversity - the 'evo-devo revolution' - which bring to light deep homologies between organisms. In dispensing with the classical notion of syntacticparameters, the authors argue that language variation, like biodiversity, is the result of experience and thus not a part of the language faculty in the narrow sense. They also examine the nature of this core language faculty, the primary categories with which it is concerned, the operations it performs, the syntactic constraints it poses on semantic interpretation and the role of phases in bridging the gap between brain and syntax. Written in language accessible to a wide audience, TheBiolinguistic Enterprise will appeal to scholars and students of linguistics, cognitive science, biology, and natural language processing.},

We consider different ways in which CR and NB might be connected. These are (1) a correlational way, in which NB computation is correlated with the CR theory; (2) an integrated way, in which NB data provide crucial evidence for choosing among CR theories; and (3) an explanatory way, in which properties of NB explain why a CR theory is the way it is. We examine various questions concerning the prospects for explanatory connections in particular, including to what extent it makes sense to say that NB could be specialised for particular computations.},

  abstract = {This volume offers the reader a wide and updated view of some of the most important approaches to three key questions in contemporary syntactic theory: What are the operations available for (syntactic) structure-building in natural languages? What are the triggers behind those structure-building operations? Which constraints operate on the structure-building operations available? All the chapters in this book aim at providing new answers to these questions on the basis of a detailed discussion of a wide range of phenomena (gapping, Right-Node-Raising, Comparative Deletion, Across-the-Board (ATB) movement, tough-constructions, nominalizations, scope interactions, wh-movement, A-movement, Case and Agreement relations, among others), and using evidence from a rich variety of languages (Brazilian Portuguese, Bulgarian, Croatian, English, German, Icelandic, Japanese, Spanish, Vata, or Vietnamese, etc.). The proposals presented clearly illustrate the shift in the locus of the explanation of linguistic phenomena that characterizes contemporary linguistic theory. A shift, in many cases, from a model which relied on properties of systems external to narrow syntax (such as the Lexicon or the PF component), to one which relies on properties of the structure-building mechanisms available.},

Moreover, it does so by employing simplest Merge and third-factor minimal search for label identification. Our extension of Chomsky's analysis to A-movement operates without any appeal to Merge-over-Move or to lexical arrays or subarrays. This in turn renders the concept "phase" itself no longer necessary in analyzing the core cases of illicit A-movement, shown to reduce to labeling failure. Implications of this result and the nature of the long-standing evidence for strict cyclicity are discussed.},

We will argue that external pair-Merge of heads overcomes a paradox concerning bridge verb constructions. In the final section we note that external pair-Merge of heads is, in effect, a “presyntactic” morphological (“word formation”) rule entailed by current syntactic theory. The extent to which the standard theory of morphological operations can be subsumed by external pair-Merge of heads, further unifying syntax and (aspects of) morphology is left for further research.},

Working within the Minimalist Program and focusing on English, the authors develop an original theory of generative syntax, providing illuminating new analyses of some central syntactic constructions. Two key questions are explored: first, can the Extended Projection Principle (EPP) be eliminated from Minimalist analysis without loss, and perhaps with a gain in empirical coverage; and second, is the construct 'A-Chain' similarly eliminable? The authors argue that neither EPP nor the A-chain is in fact a property of Universal Grammar, but rather their descriptive content can be deduced from independently motivated properties of lexical items, in accordance with overarching principles governing derivation. In investigating these questions, a range of new data is introduced, and existing data re-analyzed, presenting a pioneering challenge to fundamental assumptions in syntactic theory.},

Section 1 equates that order and its typical effects with an order of parameter setting. The question is how the acquisition procedure derives the order from input evidence. Section 2 proposes a systematic input reduction for functional categories as the key; the reduction residue contains no more than a single non-acquired functional category 〈F?〉 that is first seen as an optional element only. If that functional category has turned into the most preferred option, the input reduction shifts its acquisition focus to the next functional category. Section 3 and 4 demonstrate how quantitative proportions within the child’s input reduction determine the underlying order as SOV in Dutch before the V-second shift for root sentences is derived. The child’s input reductions are claimed to follow from ignorance rather than from any a priori information. It is argued that parameters are formal properties of the grammatical system that originate as cultural discoveries made by a reflexive mind rather than being task-specific neural a prioris. Section 5 suggests that this view can be extended to syntactic islands.},

Each cycle starts with the introduction of a new head and merger of the head's selected arguments, followed by satisfaction (via checking) of the head's removable features. The theory includes no acyclic devices such as lexical arrays or comparison of derivations. Satisfaction of features is accompanied by full category movement whenever it is not blocked by morphology or constraints barring multiple specifiers. The Minimal Link Condition is viewed computationally and is naturally incorporated into Satisfy. Our precise notion of checking involves sets of features interacting in the same checking relation, and yields an account of successive cyclic movement, the distribution of expletives, EPP, and quirky case phenomena. The paper can be read as empirical evidence that the core syntactic algorithm is computationally efficient.},

This evaluation attempts to demonstrate that reliance on interface conditions encounters serious long-standing problems for the analysis of language. It also suggests that the precise formulation of Merge may, in fact, subsume the effects of those principles of efficient computation currently under investigation and might possibly render unnecessary proposals for additional structure building operations (e.g., Pair-Merge and FormSequence).},

This work discusses the different approaches to phases that have been proposed in the recent literature, arguing in favor of the thesis that the points of cyclic transfer are to be related to uninterpretable morphology (the Φ-features on the heads C and v*). This take on phases is adopted in order to investigate raising structures, binding, subjunctive dependents, and object shift (word order) in Romance languages, as well as the nature of islands.},

  abstract = {A mental representation is a system of symbols isomorphic to some aspect of the environment, used to make behavior-generating decisions that anticipate events and relations in that environment. A representational system has the following components: symbols, which refer to aspects of the environment; symbol processing operations, which generate symbols representing behaviorally required information about the environment by transforming and combining other symbols representing computationally related information; sensing and measuring processes, which relate the symbolic variables to the aspects of the world to which they refer; and decision processes, which translate decision variables into observable actions. From a behaviorist perspective, mental representations do not exist and cannot be the focus of a scientific psychology. From a cognitivist perspective, psychology is the study of mental representations, how they are computed, and how they affect behavior.},

The underlying tension is due to (the axiom of) extensionality, which—other things being equal—favors a perspective on dependencies in terms of multidominance. The above argument is developed against the backdrop of a recent exposition of minimalist syntax (Chomsky et al. in Catal J Linguist (Special Issue):229–261, 2019), which can be seen as exemplary. The resulting critical assessment should be taken as removing obstacles on the way toward proper minimalist foundations for syntactic theory.},

Eight subjects were trained to operate a lever that reinforced each press with food. The period during which responses were reinforced was then progressively reduced until it was 1 hr in every 24. The final 1-hr feeding schedule was maintained over 4 weeks. The feeding period commenced at the same time each day throughout. The food dispensers were then made inactive, and a period of extinction ensued for 6 days. The pattern of responding suggested that the fish were able to exhibit temporal discrimination in anticipation of feeding time. This pattern of responding persisted for a limited number of days during the extinction procedure. The second experiment produced evidence that operant temporal discrimination could develop under continuous illumination.},

  abstract = {A long-standing tension in Minimalist syntax is that between the structure-building operations Merge and Move on the one hand and the constraints restricting the shape of the structures built by said operations on the other. Proposals differ vastly in how much weight they attribute to each component, partially because there seems to be no principled connection between the two —- constraints can easily be grafted onto any syntactic theory, and the choice of constraints is apparently independent of the types of posited operations. As a consequence, many foundational questions still lack satisfying answers:     What kinds of constraints are there?     What is their respective power, and are there any factors that could limit it?     Are there phenomena that can only be explained via constraints?     Why would syntax have both operations and constraints? My thesis explores these and related questions from a mathematically informed perspective. The central result is that Minimalist syntax can express a constraint purely via the operation Merge iff computing said constraint requires only a finitely bounded amount of working memory iff the constraint can be defined by an extension of first-order logic known as monadic second-order logic. A peculiar lexicalization procedure is used to establish the equivalence between Merge and constraints. The procedure pushes the working memory configurations that emerge during the computation of a constraint directly into the lexical categories. Refining categories in this fashion allows the selectional restrictions of lexical items to act as a proxy through which constraints are expressed via Merge. Merge-expressible constraints are very powerful and can capture dependencies between nodes as well as the domains that such dependencies are usually relativized to. Hence almost all conditions proposed in the syntactic literature belong to this class, including transderivational constraints and economy conditions. Surprisingly, the power of Merge-expressible constraints does not vary with respect to the type of syntactic tree structure they are stated over (phrase structure tree, multidominance tree, derivation tree), nor is it affected by locality restrictions. With respect to the issues raised above, then, the emerging picture is that the kind of constraints entertained by syntacticians belong to a uniform class of structural conditions that is computationally well-behaved and tightly linked to the foundations of the framework. The existence of these constraints in language is a natural consequence of the core component of Minimalist syntax: feature-driven Merge.},

  abstract = {One of the central changes in 20th century linguistics was the reconceptualization of language as a cognitive ability rather than merely an abstract relational system of signs —- in the terminology of Chomsky (1986), the move from E-language to I-language. This shift entails that linguistic theory is no longer measured exclusively by empirical coverage, succinctness of description, and conceptual appeal, but must also address the question of how language is integrated into our mental architecture. A lot of prominent work along these lines has focused on the supposed modularity of language, i.e. whether language is autonomous or shares resources with other mental capacities. This debate has been conducted at a very high level of abstraction, and as a result it sidesteps a more tangible issue: what kind of cognitive resources are actually needed to support the data structures and operations employed by I-language? Formal language theory makes it possible to tie the complexity of linguistic patterns to specific claims about memory organization and thus provides an indirect way of measuring the cognitive demands of language. This is not a straight-forward exercise, though, and care must be taken to conceptualize these patterns in the right way. In this paper, I argue based on a battery of previous results that even though syntax and phonology involve patterns of vastly different complexity, a linguistically informed perspective of the underlying dependencies reveals surprising similarities regarding their memory infrastructure.},

The answer is rooted in the computational framework of subregular complexity, which has already been fruitfully applied to phonology. The computational perspective reveals that Merge belongs to the class TSL (tier-based strictly local) if the grammar also allows for recursive adjunction. Any cognitive device that can handle this level of computational complexity also possesses all the resources that are needed for Move. In fact, Merge and Move are remarkably similar when viewed as instances of TSL. Consequently, Move has no additional computational or conceptual cost attached to it and comes essentially for free.},

  abstract = {Understanding the evolution of language requires evidence regarding origins and processes that led to change. In the last 40 years, there has been an explosion of research on this problem as well as a sense that considerable progress has been made. We argue instead that the richness of ideas is accompanied by a poverty of evidence, with essentially no explanation of how and why our linguistic computations and representations evolved. We show that, to date, 1) studies of nonhuman animals provide virtually no relevant parallels to human linguistic communication, and none to the underlying biological capacity; 2) the fossil and archaeological evidence does not inform our understanding of the computations and representations of our earliest ancestors, leaving details of origins and selective pressure unresolved; 3) our understanding of the genetics of language is so impoverished that there is little hope of connecting genes to linguistic processes any time soon; 4) all modeling attempts have made unfounded assumptions, and have provided no empirical tests, thus leaving any insights into language’s origins unverifiable. Based on the current state of evidence, we submit that the most fundamental questions about the origins and evolution of our linguistic capacity remain as mysterious as ever, with considerable uncertainty about the discovery of either relevant or conclusive evidence that can adjudicate among the many open hypotheses. We conclude by presenting some suggestions about possible paths forward.},

  abstract = {Chomsky's extension of his Problems of Projection proposal retains the labeling algorithm and deduces EPP and ECP effects from labeling. However, the notion of weak heads, the crucial assumption in this extended proposal, is problematic both conceptually and empirically. Conceptually, the framework threatens to complicate Minimal Search, which ought to be simple, as an instance of the “third factor” in language design. Empirically, the framework cannot explain the derivation of English infinitival clauses, nor can it explain labeling in languages like Japanese. I resolve these problems by eliminating the notion of weak heads. In exploring syntax without weak heads, I reconsider Feature Inheritance. Given that a central argument for obligatory Feature Inheritance (involving simultaneity of feature valuation and Transfer) is invalid on Chomsky's approach, I propose that Feature Inheritance is an optional operation. Then, I revise a proposal that External Pair Merge of heads is involved in the derivation of verbs with a CP complement and in the passive construction. I pose two problems for this proposal, one involving theta roles and one involving the derivation of the passive of verbs with a CP complement. My framework derives not only instances deemed problematic under the External Pair Merge proposal but also the unergative and ergative constructions, whose derivations are otherwise unclear.},

One crucial aspect of the proposed theory of structural symmetry involves interweaving effects, which emerge as categorial determination of different sizes and types. The present thesis discusses three such cases: Nominative-Genitive Conversion, Head-Internal Relative Clauses, and Predicate Cleft Constructions. It is further argued that Agreement Symmetry and Structural Symmetry interact with the Case theory and bring far-reaching implications for aspects of syntactic phenomena.},

In this book Norbert Hornstein, one of the most influential linguists working on syntax, discusses a topical set of issues in syntactic theory, including a number of original proposals at the cutting edge of research in this area. He provides a theory of the basic grammatical operations and suggests that there is only one that is distinctive to language. If this theory is correct then this narrows the evolutionary gap between verbal and non-verbal primates, thus facilitating the rapid evolutionary emergence of our linguistic capacity.},

Accessibly written, it presents the basic principles and techniques of the minimalist program, looking firstly at analyses within Government and Binding Theory (the Minimalist Program's predecessor), and gradually introducing minimalist alternatives. Minimalist models of grammar are presented in a step-by-step fashion, and the ways in which they contrast with GB analyses are clearly explained. Spanning a decade of minimalist thinking, this textbook will enable students to develop a feel for the sorts of questions and problems that minimalism invites, and to master the techniques of minimalist analysis. Over 100 exercises are provided, encouraging them to put these skills into practice. Understanding Minimalism will be an invaluable text for intermediate and advanced students of syntactic theory, and will set a solid foundation for further study and research within Chomsky's minimalist framework.},

  abstract = {The primary aim in this paper is to propose a phrase structure for adjunction that is compatible with the precepts of Bare Phrase Structure (BPS). Current accounts are at odds with the central vision of BPS and current practice leans more to descriptive eclecticism than to theoretical insight. A diagnosis for this conceptual disarray is suggested here: It stems from a deeply held though seldom formulated intuition; the tacit view that adjuncts are the abnormal case while arguments describe the grammatical norm. In actuality, it is argued, adjuncts are so well behaved that they require virtually no grammatical support to function properly. Arguments, in contrast, are refractory and require grammatical aid to allow them to make any propositional contribution. This last remark should come as no surprise to those with neo-Davidsonian semantic sympathies. Connoisseurs of this art form are well versed in the important role that grammatical (aka, thematic) roles play in turning arguments into             modifiers of events. Such fulcra are not required for meaningfully integrating adjuncts.             into sentences. In what follows, we take this difference to be of the greatest significance             and we ask ourselves what this might imply for the phrase structure of adjunction.},

The main aim is to lay out one specific way in which the derivational aspects of a grammatical theory can contribute to the cognitive claims made by that theory, to demonstrate that it is not only a theory's posited representations that testable cognitive hypotheses derive from. This requires, however, an understanding of grammatical derivations that initially appears somewhat unnatural in the context of modern generative syntax. The second aim is to argue that this impression is misleading: certain accidents of the way our theories developed over the decades have led to a situation that makes it artificially difficult to apply the understanding of derivations that I adopt to modern generative grammar. Comparisons with other derivational formalisms and with earlier generative grammars serve to clarify the question of how derivational systems can, in general, constitute hypotheses about mental phenomena.},

  abstract = {Sentences with the verb exist and with a lexical DP in subject position show no definiteness effect. This suggests that the definiteness effect is keyed in English to the presence of expletive there . More strongly put, a definiteness effect is invariably found whenever expletive there (or a counterpart of it in other languages, whether pronounced or not) is present. This effect may in some languages be limited to the case of unstressed pronouns. Expletive there and its counterparts originate within the associate (in a way that accounts for the expletive being there , and not then ). In part, this conclusion is driven by anti-homophony. Freeze noted that English is exceptional in having expletive there in subject position. The proposal will be that this is related to English allowing preposition-stranding under A-movement. The definiteness effect itself results from a blocking effect, probably not specific to existential sentences, that certain determiners such as the impose on the movement of expletive there from its DP-internal position up to a sentential subject position.},

  abstract = {The present paper argues that ECM subjects undergo A-movement to Spec of ForceP in the subordinate clause, but not to the matrix object position, in Japanese ECM constructions where a complementizer is required for the embedded clause. ECM subjects are argued to move to Spec of ForceP, accessible to the matrix predicate, while a topic fills the lower TopP. It is suggested that an ECM subject appears in ForceP on the grounds that it enters into ϕ-feature agreement with the Force head, and that the Case feature of the ECM subject is valued as accusative by the matrix verb. It is further shown that when a major subject construction, where both major subject and thematic subject are marked with nominative case, is embedded under the ECM verb, the major subject rather than the thematic subject of the embedded predicate is raised to Spec of ForceP to serve as an ECM argument.},

Linguistic pronunciations can be described in ways that relate them to our motor system (e.g., to the movement of our lips and tongue). But how do linguistic meanings relate to our nonlinguistic cognitive systems? As a case study, we defend an explicit proposal about the meaning of most by comparing it to the closely related more: whereas more expresses a comparison between two independent subsets, most expresses a subset–superset comparison. Six experiments with adults and children demonstrate that these subtle differences between their meanings influence how participants organize and interrogate their visual world. In otherwise identical situations, changing the word from most to more affects preferences for picture–sentence matching (experiments 1–2), scene creation (experiments 3–4), memory for visual features (experiment 5), and accuracy on speeded truth judgments (experiment 6). These effects support the idea that the meanings of more and most are mental representations that provide detailed instructions to conceptual systems.},

  abstract = {The generative enterprise in linguistics is roughly 50 years old, and it is reasonable to ask what progress the field has made in certain areas over the past five decades. This article will address the study of verbal argument structure. Research in generative linguistics without question has productively explored verbal argument structure within a general structuralist framework familiar from anthropology and the humanities, uncovering patterns and correlations across languages in the syntactic distribution and behavior of verbal arguments identified by their semantic roles, and providing structured explanations that capture these patterns in a compact and intuitively explanatory way. But this article will ask whether progress has been made in a different sense – toward a scientific understanding of language. In other words, has the generative enterprise made good on its promise to break from the structuralist anthropological tradition (Sapir, 1921, Bloomfield, 1933) and provide an account of argument structure within a general account of knowledge of language. If such progress has been made, we could argue that researchers in human psychology and neuroscience must take note of the latest theory of argument structure to inform their experiments, not just any account that traffics in thematic roles, word order, and case marking.},

  abstract = {The study of the biological foundations of language is sometimes called biolinguistics . This particular term finds its historical origins in the 1950s, and for various reasons it has also gained considerable traction in recent years. While its increasing use apparently signals an equally increasing interest in biology, apart from a few exceptions not much is added to and beyond standard linguistic theorizing by those linguists who use it, resulting in a complex and confusing literature. This state of affairs has led, on the one hand, to the perpetuation of proposals that are hard to relate to the biological literature and, on the other, to ill-placed criticism on the progress and even the very legitimacy of a biologically-informed study of language. By reviewing different ways in which research under the biolinguistics label has been carried out, as well as some common criticisms, we hope to dispel some misconceptions about what constitutes a biolinguistic approach, as well as point out what we contend is real progress in the study of the biological bases and evolution of the human language faculty, to which the term is better and rightly applied.},

I begin by constructing a formal definition a version of long-distance Agree in which a higher object values a feature on a lower object, and modify that definition to reflect various several versions of Agree that have been proposed in the “minimalist” literature. I then discuss the theoretical implications of these formal definitions, arguing that Agree (i ) muddies our understanding of the evolution of language, (ii ) requires a new conception of the lexicon, (iii ) objectively and significantly increases the complexity of syntactic derivations, and (iv ) unjustifiably violates NTC in all its non-vacuous forms.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel account for the emergence of human language syntax. Like many evolutionary innovations, language arose from the adventitious combination of two pre-existing, simpler systems that had been evolved for other functional tasks. The first system, Type E(xpression), is found in birdsong, where the same song marks territory, mating availability, and similar “expressive” functions. The second system, Type L(exical), has been suggestively found in non-human primate calls and in honeybee waggle dances, where it demarcates predicates with one or more “arguments,” such as combinations of calls in monkeys or compass headings set to sun position in honeybees. We show that human language syntax is composed of two layers that parallel these two independently evolved systems: an “E” layer resembling the Type E system of birdsong and an “L” layer providing words. The existence of the “E” and “L” layers can be confirmed using standard linguistic methodology. Each layer, E and L, when considered separately, is characterizable as a finite state system, as observed in several non-human species. When the two systems are put together they interact, yielding the unbounded, non-finite state, hierarchical structure that serves as the hallmark of full-fledged human language syntax. In this way, we account for the appearance of a novel function, language, within a conventional Darwinian framework, along with its apparently unique emergence in a single species.},

Although these three NSIs behave differently, we demonstrate that the two traditional NSI categories of Negative Concord Items (NCIs) and Negative Polarity Items (NPIs) are sufficient for characterizing these items.~ We argue that Wh-MO and XP-sika are NCIs, thus they contain a neg feature ([uneg]) which enters into (upward) agreement with its corresponding an uninterpretable feature ([ineg]). The third NSI, rokuna N, is an NPI. Two issues arise with XP-sika. First, it has an inherent focus feature, which distinguishes it from the other two. Second, this focus feature is syntactically active – meaning that movement is forced – only for the argument XP-sika. We argue that these properties of XP-sika associated with focus are independent of NP-sika as an NSI, and should be dealt with as an overall property of Japanese being a discourse configurational language. We introduce a case-theoretic solution to how focus becomes syntactically active solely with argument XP-sika.},

  abstract = {Japanese has functional elements with grammatical, semantic, or pragmatic functions. Case markers mark grammatical relations; the Q-particle clause-types the sentence as an interrogative; and the topic marker designates a phrase as the topic of the sentence. Along with these functions, we argue that these functional elements have a uniform function of assisting in the labeling of structures. There are two ways in which they do so. In one case, a functional element attaches to an item that cannot otherwise project to induce projection, an idea we base on Richards’s Contiguity Theory. In the other case, a functional element attaches to an item that is projectable but requires the projection to be blocked, allowing a sister item to project. The Q-particle is an example of a functional element that, when attached to an otherwise unprojectable C, induces the C to project. In contrast, case markers attach to XPS, which are inherently projectable, and block them from projecting, allowing the sister element to project, following Saito. The same goes for topic marking. Across languages, many functional elements have this role of assisting in the labeling of structures. The Q-particle in Japanese, which allows the C to project, is similar to agreement in Romance, in which the agreement morpheme on T induces the T to project without the need to move an element to the specifier. Case marking, which blocks projection of a XP, is similar to augment vowels in Bantu, and it is no accident that these vowels have a case-like distribution. Finally, we speculate on how case marking and movement, both functioning to allow the sister node to project, have common properties of blocking projection.},

In this study Andrea Moro identifies a new category of copular sentences, namely inverse copular sentences, where the noun phrase which co-occurs with the verb phrase plays the role of predicate, occupying the position which is canonically reserved for subjects, and the subject is embedded in the verb phrase. The consequences of such a discovery are pervasive. Four distinct areas of syntax are unified into a unique natural class. Along with inverse copular sentences, existential sentences, sentences with seem and unaccusative constructions are analysed as involving the raising of a predicative noun phrase to the most prominent position in the clause structure. In addition, new light is shed on some classical issues such as the distribution and nature of expletives, locality theory, cliticization phenomena, possessive constructions, and the cross-linguistic variations of the Definiteness Effect.},

  abstract = {Movement is a specific property of human languages and one that has at least implicitly been recognized in all linguistic theories. The most recent development posits that movement is forced by morphological requirements (Chomsky 1995). In this paper I will suggest a different approach to movement, suggesting that it is essentially related to the geometry of phrase structure. A weak version of Kayne's 1994 theory of the antisymmetry of syntax, namely ‘dynamic antisymmetry’ will be introduced. In the strong version, UG only allowed for antisymmetrical configurations, in terms of c-command. Within dynamic antisymmetry, however, symmetrical configurations can be generated, provided that movement makes them antisymmetric before spell-out. In other words, I will suggest that movement is a symmetry-breaking phenomenon, i.e. it is triggered by purely geometrical factors as opposed to morphological ones. Data will range from small clause constructions (both in copular sentences and believe-type verbs) to wh-movement in interrogatives. Italian and English will be the major sources of examples.},

  abstract = {The central idea of Dynamic Antisymmetry is that movement and phrase structure are not independent properties of grammar; more specifically, that movement is triggered by the geometry of phrase structure. Assuming a minimalist framework, movement is traced back to the necessity for natural language to organize words in linear order at the interface with the perceptual-articulatory module. Andrea Moro uses this innovative perspective to analyze several empirical domains, focusing on small clauses, split wh-movement, and clitic constructions. In a final speculative chapter, he examines the general consequences for the design of grammar implied by Dynamic Antisymmetry. The book is self-contained, with a synopsis of current theories of movement and a synthetic presentation of the theory of antisymmetry. An appendix presents the essentials of a unified theory of copular sentences, which plays a central role in the argument and has several important consequences for syntax, for example, for expletives and locality.

(b) These features are ordered on lexical items. (c) All phrases are phases. (d) Edge features that trigger intermediate movement steps can only be added before the phase head becomes inert. Given (a–d), it follows from the PIC that extraction from XP is blocked if the operation that has merged XP is the final operation taking place in a phase: a last-merged specifier is a barrier because no edge feature can be inserted that might extract some item out of it; this induces a PIC violation on the following cycle. The analysis can be extended to cover freezing effects. Furthermore, it predicts the existence of the melting effect, illustrated in German and Czech: local scrambling in front of what would otherwise qualify as a last-merged specifier renders the specifier transparent for extraction. The most important assumption made here is that the timing of edge feature insertion is crucial (before vs. after in (d)). Accordingly, the analysis can be viewed as an argument supporting a strictly derivational organization of grammar.},

This restriction, referred to as the H-α schema, will be shown to derive a number of empirically grounded locality constraints in tandem with the Phase-Impenetrability Condition (Chomsky 2000, 2004, 2008), a desirable result both in terms of breadth of empirical coverage and theory-internal simplicity. Another important consequence is that the notion of endocentricity/headedness can no longer be attributed to (X-bar theoretic) projection. It will be claimed that each SO \{H, α\} can be efficiently assigned endocentric interpretation by the Conceptual-Intentional system (CI) and the Sensorimotor system (SM) via minimal search of LIs—H is always the head of \{H, α\}, primarily configuring the interpretation of the SO. Full and consistent satisfaction of Full Interpretation is thereby achieved, maximally corroborating the desideratum of the Strong Minimalist Thesis.},

Since Chomsky’s (1995 a) Minimalist Program, the idea that the faculty of language (FL) is designed as simply and minimally as possible has been pursued. The idea is further explored in Chomsky (2005), which defines three factors which determine properties of human language and argues that many of those properties should be attributed to the third factor (i.e. the one which is not unique to FL), which leads to reduc- ing the contents of FL itself. In terms of structure-building, language/construc- tion-specific transformational rules and phrase structure rules are reduced to a simple rule in the Minimalist Program – namely, Merge, which combines X and Y and forms a set \{X, Y\}. Therefore, structure-building by Merge alone should be preferable under the spirit of the Minimalist Program. However, Chomsky’s (2015) structure-building relies on the deletion operation (in addition to Merge) within the syntax to account for that-trace effects/null complementizers.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I argue against the standard analysis of so-called split topics in German as discontinuous noun phrases (van Riemsdijk 1989). Building in part on Fanselow 1988, I show that the construction rather involves two morphosyntactically autonomous nominal constituents that are predicatively related in underlying form. This predication is syntactically unstable, however. Merge of two XPs within a single argument or adjunct position yields a symmetric structure for which no label (“head”) can be detected by Minimal Search (“for any syntactic object α,β,α is the head if α is a lexical item”; see Chomsky 2008). Therefore, one of the two noun phrases must move at the phase level in order to render the structure asymmetric; in case the stranded noun phrase is elliptical, the impression of a discontinuous constituent arises. By providing a principled explanation for split topicalization in these terms, the analysis furnishes evidence for an architecture in which Merge applies freely (pace recent claims to the contrary, e.g., in Kayne 2010), and as an asymmetrizing device when applying internally (as movement), in the spirit of Moro 2000 and Chomsky 2013.},

Issues addressed include the theoretical significance, content, and role of parameters within minimalism; whether or not variation should be strongly or weakly accounted for by syntactic factors; and the explicitness (or lack of it) that should be assumed with respect to the conditions imposed by narrow syntax. The first part contains chapters that consider the term parameter to be a relevant theoretical notion under minimalist tenets. In the second part, on the other hand, chapters either argue that the term ‘parameter’ amounts to no more than a label to describe variation, or assign it a less prominent role. Instead, language variation is attributed to socio‐linguistic factors, language contact, frequency of use, or simply to options in the externalization of abstract syntactic relations.},

First and foremost is the relationship between its two parent disciplines, psychology and linguistics, a relationship which has changed and advanced over the half century of the field's independent existence. At the beginning of the 21st Century, psycholinguistics forms part of the rapidly developing enterprise known as cognitive neuroscience, in which the relationship between biology and behavior plays a central role. Psycholinguistics is about language in communication, so that the relationship between language production and comprehension has always been important, and as psycholinguistics is an experimental discipline, it is likewise essential to find the right relationship between model and experiment. This book focuses in turn on each of these four cornerstone relationships: Psychology and Linguistics, Biology and Behavior, Production and Comprehension, and Model and Experiment. The authors are from different disciplinary backgrounds, but share a commitment to clarify the ways that their research illuminates the essential nature of the psycholinguistic enterprise.},

In this short reply, I wish to demonstrate that Zeijlstra's proposal is unsuitable as a theory of φ-agreement (i.e., of morpho-phonologically overt co-variance in φ-features between a finite verb or a tense/aspect/mood marker and a nominal argument). I survey two empirical domains, from Tsez and Basque, demonstrating this point; I then briefly discuss the consequences of these facts for the empirical domains that Zeijlstra examines.},

That is, there is no such thing as “abstract” ϕ-agreement, null across the entire paradigm. Applying the same diagnostic to instances of clitic doubling, we see that these do involve syntactic agreement. This cannot be because clitic doubling is agreement; it behaves like movement (and unlike agreement) in a variety of respects. Nor can this be because clitic doubling, qua movement, is contingent on prior agreement—since the claim that all movement depends on prior agreement is demonstrably false. Clitic doubling requires prior agreement because it is an instance of non-local head movement,~and movement of X0 to Y0 always requires a prior syntactic relationship between Y0 and XP. In local head movement (the kind that is already permitted under the Head Movement Constraint), this requirement is trivially satisfied by (c-)selection. But in non-local cases, agreement~must fill this role.},

Beginning at an elementary level, the book introduces grammatical concepts and sets out the theoretical foundations of Principles and Parameters and Universal Grammar, before progressing in stages towards more complex phenomena. Each chapter contains a workbook section, in which students are encouraged to make their own analyses of English phrases and sentences through exercises, model answers, and 'helpful hints'.

  abstract = {Under current assumptions, the structural representation of a clause consists of three kinds of structural layers, each layer an instantiation of the X-bar schema: 1. The lexical layer, headed by the verb, the structural layer in which theta assignment takes place. 2. The inflectional layer, headed by functional heads corresponding to concrete or abstract morphological specifications on the verb, and responsible for the licensing of argumental features such as case and agreement. 3. The complementizer layer, typically headed by a free functional morpheme, and hosting topics and various operator-like elements such as interrogative and relative pronouns, focalized elements, etc. In the mid eighties, each layer was identified with a single X-bar projection (VP, IP, CP), but this assumption quickly turned out to be too simplistic. Under the impact of Pollock’s (1989) influential analysis of verb movement, IP dissolved into a series of functional projections, each corresponding to system (Agr, T, Asp,…). Kayne’s (1984) binary branching hypothesis naturally led to the postulation of multiple VP layers for multi-argument verbs, e.g. along the lines of Larson (1988) and much related work.},

I propose a notational device which draws the distinction in a way which solves technical problems for the labeling algorithm. Focusing on phrasal movement, I show how the “halting problem” for wh-movement, and in particular the freezing effects arising in criterial positions, can be derived from labeling and a maximality principle, restricting movement to maximal elements with a given label. Looking then at head movement, I argue that it can be made consistent with the No Tampering condition, and work out the labeling algorithm for structures derived by head movement. Finally, I argue that the ban against excorporation in head movement can be analyzed as a case of freezing, and traced back, much as freezing in phrasal movement, to the maximality principle relativized to the head – phrase distinction.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the labeling mechanism in Japanese and other languages that lack φ-feature agreement. It is proposed in Chomsky (2013) that φ-feature sharing between the subject and T makes the labeling of finite clauses possible. It has also been assumed that Case is required for and valued through φ-feature agreement. (See, for example, Chomsky 2008.) These raise fundamental questions about the syntax of languages without φ-feature agreement.Adopting Bošković’s (2007) proposal to divorce Case valuation from φ-feature agreement, I argue that suffixal Case and predicate inflection make phrases opaque for search, and serve to aid labeling in Japanese. The hypothesis provides explanations for the outstanding syntactic properties of the language, such as multiple subject sentences, semantically vacuous scrambling, compound verbs with specific constraints, and argument ellipsis. The analysis of argument ellipsis is based on Richards’ (2003) hypothesis that elided constituents count as heads in computation. In Section 5, I extend the analysis to other phenomena, including N’-ellipsis in Japanese and object ellipsis in Chinese. I also consider the labeling of finite clauses in Malayalam, which has neither subject agreement nor suffixal nominative Case. I suggest that Case valuation, instead of φ-feature agreement, creates the configuration of feature sharing for labeling.},

It examines the position of the verb with respect to a wide selection of hierarchically ordered adverbs, as laid out in Cinque’s (1999) seminal work. The volume uses extensive empirical data to demonstrate that, contrary to traditional assumptions, it is possible to identify at least four distinct macro-typologies in the Romance languages: these macro-typologies stem from a compensatory mechanism between syntax and morphology in licensing the Tense, Aspect, and Mood interpretation of the verb. It adopts a hybrid cartographic / minimalist approach, in which cartography provides the empirical tools of investigation, and minimalist theory provides the technical motivations for the movement phenomena that are observed. It provides a valuable tool for the examination of fundamental morphosyntactic properties from a cross-Romance perspective, and constitutes a useful point of departure for further investigations into the nature and triggers of verb movement cross-linguistically.},

I assume this is an empirical fact about the actual causal relations between mental processes and brains. It says simply that certain brain processes are sufficient for intentionality. (2) Instantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of intentionality. The main argument of this paper is directed at establishing this claim. The form of the argument is to show how a human agent could instantiate the program and still not have the relevant intentionality. These two propositions have the following consequences: (3) The explanation of how the brain produces intentionality cannot be that it does it by instantiating a computer program. This is a strict logical consequence of 1 and 2. (4) Any mechanism capable of producing intentionality must have causal powers equal to those of the brain. This is meant to be a trivial consequence of 1. (5) Any attempt literally to create intentionality artificially (strong AI) could not succeed just by designing programs but would have to duplicate the causal powers of the human brain. This follows from 2 and 4.“Could a machine think?” On the argument advanced here only a machine could think, and only very special kinds of machines, namely brains and machines with internal causal powers equivalent to those of brains. And that is why strong AI has little to tell us about thinking, since it is not about machines but about programs, and no program by itself is sufficient for thinking.},

  abstract = {Embodied Cognition is a wide-ranging research program drawing fromand inspiring work in psychology, neuroscience, ethology, philosophy,linguistics, robotics, and artificial intelligence. Whereas traditionalcognitive science also encompasses these disciplines, it finds commonpurpose in a conception of mind wedded to computationalism: mentalprocesses are computational processes; the brain, quacomputer, is the seat of cognition. In contrast, embodied cognitionvariously rejects or reformulates the computational commitments ofcognitive science, emphasizing the significance of an agent’sphysical body in cognitive abilities. Unifying investigators ofembodied cognition is the idea that the body or the body’sinteractions with the environment constitute or contribute to cognitionin ways that require a new framework for its investigation. Mentalprocesses are not, or not only, computational processes. The brain isnot a computer, or not the seat of cognition., Once a fringe movement, embodied cognition now enjoys a fair amount ofprominence. Unlike, say, ecological psychology, which has faced anuphill battle for mainstream acceptance, embodied cognition has gaineda substantial following. The appointment of researchers who take anembodied perspective to cognition would, today, raise few eyebrows.Embodied cognition has been the subject of numerous articles inpopular outlets. Moreover, there is not an area of cognitivescience—perception, language, learning, memory, categorization,problem solving, emotion, social cognition—that has not receivedan embodied “make-over.”, None of this is to say, of course, that embodied cognition does notface hard questions, or has escaped harsh criticism. The numerous andsometimes incompatible claims it makes about the body’s role incognition and the myriad methods it employs for understanding this rolemake it ripe for philosophical reflection. Critics charge embodiedcognition with embracing a depleted conception of cognition, or withnot offering a genuine replacement to computational cognitive science,or with claiming that bodies play a constitutive role in cognition whenin fact their role is merely causal. Proponents have responded to allof these objections. A welcome byproduct of these debates is a newperspective on some old philosophical questions concerning what mindsare, what concepts are, and how to understand the nature andsignificance of representation.}

  abstract = {Based on the scope of negation in Japanese, the dissertation establishes a generalization that all vP-internal phrases move out of NegP in Japanese. The main argument concerns reconstruction, which allows a moved element to be interpreted at the original site rather than the surface position. It is shown that reconstruction applies to moved elements quite generally except for those that occur with adjoined focus particles in both Japanese and English. A semantic explanation for this is provided on the basis of Fox’s (2003) trace conversion, an interpretive mechanism that serves to interpret movement chains. Given the mechanism, it is shown that a number of differences between Japanese and English with respect to scope relations between arguments and negation can be derived from a single structural difference: Only in Japanese, objects obligatorily move to a position above negation. The analysis of the anti-reconstruction property of focus particles presented in the dissertation is extended to provide explanations for the Neg-split phenomenon in English, the fact that a contrastive topic is interpreted as the focus of negation in Japanese, and the interpretive properties of focus particles in German and various kinds of disjunction phrases in English, Japanese, and Korean. Regarding the reason for the movement of vP-internal phrases in Japanese, it is shown that it must occur due to the morphological merger of heads. It is argued that T, Neg, v and V are combined into a word by morphological merger in Japanese, and that morphological merger is subject to a structural adjacency condition that prohibits overt elements from intervening between T and V. It follows then that all vP-internal phrases must move out of NegP for morphological merger to apply. The analysis is shown to make correct predictions for a number of properties of constructions with a variety of complex predicates, such as causatives and potentials. A further consequence of the analysis is that Japanese does not have the process of su-support that parallels English do-support.},

  abstract = {Hypothesizing that every syntactic object reaching the interfaces must be labeled, Chomsky (2013, 2015) introduce an independent label-identifying operation, Labeling Algorithm (LA). This newly proposed LA, which is an instance of Minimal Search, is assumed to search for not only the categorial feature of heads but also any agreeing features shared by two heads to determine the label of a given syntactic object. This paper argues, however, that postulation of the latter type of search by LA (i.e., locating agreeing features) adds a computational burden to the grammar by forcing LA to perform two different types of search, namely, a “comparison search” in addition to the widely agreed-upon Minimal Search. This paper also addresses some conceptual and empirical problems that arise from the paired form of the non-categorial label, \&lt;φ, φ\&gt;, whose introduction results from the problematic comparison search by LA. To solve these problems, I present an alternative analysis in which LA searches only for the categorial feature of heads. Consequently, neither comparison search nor the paired form of the label, \&lt;φ, φ\&gt;, becomes necessary in the analysis.},

  abstract = {This dissertation explores the formal flexibility of syntactic categories. The main proposal is that Universal Grammar (UG) only provides templatic guidance for syntactic category formation and organization but leaves many other issues open, including issues internal to a single category and issues at the intercategorial, system level: these points that UG "does not care about" turn out to enrich the categorial ontology of human language in important ways.     The dissertation consists of seven chapters. After a general introduction in Chapter 1, I lay out some foundational issues regarding features and categories in Chapter 2 and delineate a featural metalanguage comprising four components: specification, valuation, typing, and granularity. Based on that I put forward a templatic definition for syntactic categories, which unifies the combinatorial and taxonomic perspectives under the notion mergeme. Then, a detailed overview of the "categorial universe" I work with is presented, which shows that the syntactic category system (SCS) is an intricate web structured by five layers of abstraction divided into three broad levels of concern: the individual level (layers 1–2), the global level (layers 3–4), and the supraglobal level (layer 5). In the subsequent chapters I explore the template-flexibility pairs at each abstraction layer, with Chapters 3–4 focusing on the first layer, Chapter 5 on the second layer, and Chapter 6 on the third and fourth layers; the fifth layer is not in the scope of this dissertation.     Chapter 3 examines a special type of category defined by an underspecified mergeme, the defective category, which behaves like a "chameleon" in that it gets assimilated into~whatever nondefective category it merges with. This characteristic makes it potentially useful in analyzing certain adjunction structures, and I explore this potential by two case studies, one focusing on modifier-head compounds and the other on sentence-final particles. Chapter 4 examines another special type of category defined by the absence of a mergeme, the Root category. Deductive reasoning leads me to propose a generalized root syntax, according to which roots are not confined to lexical categorial environments but may legally merge with and hence "support" any non-Root category. I demonstrate the empirical consequences of this theory by a comprehensive study of the half-lexical–half-functional vocabulary items in Chinese.     Chapter 5 ascends to the second abstraction layer and raises the question of whether the categorial sequences (or projection hierarchies) in human language are necessarily totally ordered, as certain analytical devices (e.g., "flavored" categories) can only be theoretically maintained if we also allow categorial sequences to be partially ordered. After a diachronic study of the flavored verbalizer \$v\_\{BE\}\$ (stative) in Chinese resultative compounds, I conclude that while "flavoring" is indeed a possible type of flexibility in the SCS, it is the deviation rather than the norm due to non-UG or "third" factors and hence should be cautiously used in syntactic analyses.     Chapter 6 ascends even higher on the ladder of abstraction and examines the global interconnection in the SCS ontology with the aid of mathematical Category theory. I formalize the functional parallelism across major parts of speech and the inheritance-based relations across granularity levels as Category-theoretic structures, which reveal further and more abstract templates and flexibility types in the SCS. A crucial mathematical concept in the formalization is epi-Adjunction. Finally, in Chapter 7 I summarize the main results of this dissertation and briefly discuss some potential directions of future research.},

  abstract = {In their recent paper, Lau, Clark, and Lappin explore the idea that the probability of the occurrence of word strings can form the basis of an adequate theory of grammar (Lau, Jey H., Alexander Clark \&amp; 15 Shalom Lappin. 2017. Grammaticality, acceptability, and probability: A prob- abilistic view of linguistic knowledge. Cognitive Science 41(5):1201–1241). To make their case, they present the results of correlating the output of several probabilistic models trained solely on naturally occurring sentences with the gradient acceptability judgments that humans report for ungrammatical sentences derived from roundtrip machine translation errors. In this paper, we first explore the logic of the Lau et\,al. argument, both in terms of the choice of evaluation metric (gradient acceptability), and in the choice of test data set (machine translation errors on random sentences from a corpus). We then present our own series of studies intended to allow for a better comparison between LCL’s models and existing grammatical theories. We evaluate two of LCL’s probabilistic models (trigrams and recurrent neural network) against three data sets (taken from journal articles, a textbook, and Chomsky’s famous colorless-green-ideas sentence), using three evaluation metrics (LCL’s gradience metric, a categorical version of the metric, and the experimental-logic metric used in the syntax literature). Our results suggest there are very real, measurable cost-benefit tradeoffs inherent in LCL’s models across the three evaluation metrics. The gain in explanation of gradience (between 13\% and 31\% of gradience) is offset by losses in the other two metrics: a 43\%-49\% loss in coverage based on a categorical metric of explaining acceptability, and a loss of 12\%-35\% in explaining experimentally-defined phenomena. This suggests that anyone wishing to pursue LCL’s models as competitors with existing syntactic theories must either be satisfied with this tradeoff, or modify the models to capture the phenomena that are not currently captured.},

Double sideward movement occurs in the following way: given a syntactic object S containing XP and YP, Merge applies to XP and YP, and creates \{XP, YP\} outside S, thus causing XP and YP to undergo sideward movement at the same time. It is argued that multiple clefts (cleft sentences with multiple phrases in the focus position) in Japanese are derived by double sideward movement of the multiple focus phrases and that this derivation is responsible for certain surprising properties of Japanese multiple clefts, some well known and others newly discovered, including the lack of island effects and the presence and absence of clausemate effects. Other consequences are discussed for the nature of operator movement and scrambling as well as for restrictions on the application of Merge.},

To achieve this goal, it is first argued that labels are not necessary for semantic interpretation. It is then proposed that labels are necessary for linearization at the PF-interface in that they serve as a device to encode structural asymmetries that are employed to determine precedence relations, which are asymmetric as well. It is also shown that LfL can remove several problems of the original labeling framework. Building on the idea that Spell-Out applies to the whole phase but not its subpart, it is illustrated that the LfL -based analysis can solve the problem concerning the variable ways of applying Spell-Out, which arises in the standard phase theory. Extending the LfL -based framework to Japanese, a novel analysis of particle-stranding ellipsis is also proposed. Incorporating some insights of recent approaches that particle-stranding ellipsis arises through a PF-deletion process, it is shown that the proposed analysis based on LfL offers a theoretically more suitable characterization of the PF-deletion process. In this way, the present article contributes to not only sharpening the core theoretical notions regarding structure building and linearization in terms of labeling but also deepening our understanding of the structure of Japanese.},

It is shown that this proposal simplifies the grammar and gains several theoretical and empirical consequences, eliminating certain unnecessary complications in Chomsky’s (2013) framework where some instances of movement are forced by the need to label. More specifically, we point out that Chomsky’s basic idea behind the implementation of labeling through movement, which assumes that a copy left behind by movement is invisible to minimal search, is not only incompatible with the copy theory of movement but also violates the No Tampering Condition. We also point out that his claim that movement is required for labeling has a redundancy problem regarding the motivation of movement, which should be avoided in the Minimalist Program. Then, we argue that the problems are easily solved if we ensure that a singleton set left after the application of Spell-Out is automatically converted into its single member. The proposed system of labeling that makes use of Spell-Out not only removes some unnecessary complications of Chomsky (2013) but also gives several novel answers to classical questions concerning the binarity of phrase structures and the structures of small clauses and there -constructions.},

Drawing together a vast body of empirical research in cognitive science, linguistics, and developmental psychology, Tomasello demonstrates that we don't need a self-contained “language instinct” to explain how children learn language. Their linguistic ability is interwoven with other cognitive abilities. Tomasello argues that the essence of language is its symbolic dimension, which rests on the uniquely human ability to comprehend intention. Grammar emerges as the speakers of a language create linguistic constructions out of recurring sequences of symbols; children pick up these patterns in the buzz of words they hear around them. All theories of language acquisition assume these fundamental skills of intention-reading and pattern-finding. Some formal linguistic theories posit a second set of acquisition processes to connect somehow with an innate universal grammar. But these extra processes, Tomasello argues, are completely unnecessary—important to save a theory but not to explain the phenomenon. For all its empirical weaknesses, Chomskian generative grammar has ruled the linguistic world for forty years. Constructing a Language offers a compellingly argued, psychologically sound new vision for the study of language acquisition},

  abstract = {It is a truism that conceptual understanding of a hypothesis is required for its empirical investigation. However the concept of recursion as articulated in the context of linguistic analysis has been perennially confused. Nowhere has this been more evident than in attempts to critique and extend Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch’s (2002) articulation. These authors put forward the hypothesis that what is uniquely human and unique to the faculty of language—the faculty of language in the narrow sense (FLN)—is a recursive system that generates and maps syntactic objects to conceptual-intentional and sensory-motor systems. This thesis was based on the standard mathematical definition of recursion as understood by Gödel and Turing, and yet has commonly been interpreted in other ways, most notably and incorrectly as a thesis about the capacity for syntactic embedding. As we explain, the recursiveness of a function is defined independent of such output, whether infinite or finite, embedded or unembedded—existent or nonexistent. And to the extent that embedding is a sufficient, though not necessary, diagnostic of recursion, it has not been established that the apparent restriction on embedding in some languages is of any theoretical import. Misunderstanding of these facts has generated research that is often irrelevant to the FLN thesis as well as to other theories of language competence that focus on its generative power of expression. This essay is an attempt to bring conceptual clarity to such discussions as well as to future empirical investigations by explaining three criterial properties of recursion: computability (i.e., rules in intension rather than lists in extension); definition by induction (i.e., rules strongly generative of structure); and mathematical induction (i.e., rules for the principled—and potentially unbounded—expansion of strongly generated structure). By these necessary and sufficient criteria, the grammars of all natural languages are recursive.},

It presents a new theory of grammatical categories - the Universal Spine Hypothesis - and reinforces generative notions of Universal Grammar while accommodating insights from linguistic typology. In essence, this new theory shows that language-specific categories are built from a small set of universal categories and language-specific units of language. Throughout the book the Universal Spine Hypothesis is compared to two alternative theories - the Universal Base Hypothesis and the No Base Hypothesis. This valuable addition to the field will be welcomed by graduate students and researchers in linguistics.},

  abstract = {The broad aim of this book is to bring a basic, but detailed description of Icelandic nominalizations to bear on the general theoretical and architectural issues that nominalizations have raised since the earliest work in generative syntax. While nominalization has long been central to theories of argument structure, and Icelandic has been an important language for the study of argument structure and syntax, Icelandic has not been brought into the general body of theoretical work on nominalization. In this book, I show that Icelandic-specific issues in the analysis of derived nominals have broad implications that go beyond the study of that one language. In particular, Icelandic provides special evidence that Complex Event Nominals (CENs), which seem to inherit their argument structure from the underlying verbs, can be formed without nominalizing a full verb phrase. This conclusion is at odds with prominent theories of nominalization which claim that CENs have the properties that they have precisely because they involve the nominalization of full verb phrases. More narrowly, I aim to develop the theory of allosemy within the framework of Distributed Morphology to account for the ambiguity of nominalizations and inheritance of argument structure. In so doing, I will show how one single syntactic structure can get distinct semantic interpretations corresponding to the range of readings that are available to derived nominals. The idea is that just as the phonological realization of terminal nodes is underspecified in syntax (so that before Vocabulary Insertion, past tense -ed and past tense -t are the same T[PAST] head), the semantic interpretation of terminal nodes is underspecified in syntax as well. Late insertion at LF inserts suppletive allosemes---semantic denotations---into terminal nodes that are underspecified semantically. I argue that the single structure at issue derives a noun from a verb before any arguments are attached, by adjoining a lexical root to a v(erb) head and adjoining the resulting verb to a n(oun) head. In addition to showing how an account grounded in allosemy can derive the ambiguity, I also explore the consequences of building nominalizations entirely with complex heads for the locality of special meanings, and articulate the function of prepositions and prefixing in Icelandic lexical meaning. The result is a broad argument for what Icelandic nominalizations tell us about argument structure and the syntax-semantics interface, along with an articulated theoretical proposal that makes several novel claims about the syntax-semantics interface within Distributed Morphology.},

Saussurean Arbitrariness is due to the conventional sound-meaning-relation of linguistic expressions. It is systematically projected (but not reduced) from Lexical Items to linguistic expressions of unrestricted complexity by the operation of Merge. This raises the question, whether this arbitrariness is an incidental byproduct of the systems complexity, which could be avoided under conditions of optimal design. With this perspective, language is compared to mental systems of comparable complexity, but without arbitrariness. Obviously, neither the visual system nor the system of music (which consists like language in auditory signals with combinatorial structure) involves arbitrariness in any sense akin to language. The by no means trivial conclusion is, that due to the conventional nature of symbolic signs, linguistic expressions can correspond to structures of any possible domain, differing thereby especially from iconic signs. The upshot of this conclusion: arbitrariness provides the space, by means of which language allows to talk about anything that can be subject to mental awareness. Arbitrariness does not fall short of optimal design, but rather allows language to be the organ of thought and its expression, which it is.},

We address this challenge using a grammar-based complexity metric, one that reflects a minimalist analysis of relative clauses for all three languages as well as structure-dependent corpus distributions. Together, these define a comprehender’s degree of uncertainty at each point in a sentence. We use this idea to quantify the intuition that people do comprehension work as they incrementally resolve ambiguity, word by word. We find that downward changes to this quantitative measure of uncertainty derive observed processing contrasts between Subject- and Object-extracted relative clauses. This demonstrates that the complexity metric, in conjunction with a minimalist grammar and corpus-based weights, accounts for the widely-observed Subject Advantage.},

Moreover, I argue that two recent proposals (Pesetsky \&amp; Torrego 2007, Bošković 2007) solve some, but not all of these problems. Finally, I argue that all these problems disappear once a simpler version of Agree is adopted where uninterpretable features can only be checked if they are c-commanded by a matching interpretable feature and not the other way round.},
