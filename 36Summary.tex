\subsection{Summary}\label{sec:360}

It is impossible to provide a maximally detailed account of all potential questions and solutions to issues surrounding labelling, affording to the fact that labelling strikes at the heart of fundamental questions about how syntax works, and how theories of syntax should be constructed. Nevertheless, this subsection has served as a sufficient review of the central questions in \pxref{ex:questions} and some proposals that exist in the literature for answering them. It has also provided some original analysis of some specific points, paving the way for the formalisation in \autoref{sec:400}, which will provide one set of answers in a precise yet necessarily provisional manner.
