\section{History of labelling}\label{sec:200}

Initially, it must be established precisely \emph{what} labelling is, best demonstrated with a historical account of the position of labels within generative grammar. Whilst this account is abbreviated in places, it provides ample detail to ground the discussion to follow, without any severe misrepresentation of the ideas in question.

In the course of this review, original analysis of historical proposals in a modern context will emerge. This provides opportunity to discuss the proposals in an informal context, shedding light on some of the conceptual issues which the informal approaches described in the literature display. This will leave a number of trails only partially explored, to be picked up in \autoref{sec:300}, which reviews more recent developments.
