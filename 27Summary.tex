\subsection{Summary}\label{sec:270}

With this, it is worth pausing the exposition in order to recapitulate the key developments of the status of labels within generative grammar as they arose under different guises.

There have been developments in the overall architecture of the grammar, from ST to MP. These have implications for the nature of the cycle, the timing of labelling and the accessibility of SOs. The nature of the rules and operations have evolved, from PS-rules which directly encode labels, to simplest Merge, which does not encode a label at all. There has also been a shift in what elements can label, from categorial features to entire LIs.

All of these issues continue to play a role in the discussion of labelling to this day. I proceed in \autoref{sec:300} to detail the status of labels, now narrowly construed as an area of investigation, in the era following \textcite{ChomskyN_2013}, summarising the important questions and the answers they receive (if any) in present work.
